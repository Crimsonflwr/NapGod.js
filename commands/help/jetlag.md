Being on a polyphasic schedule while also travelling is possible but hard to pull off. If time zones are switched there are 3 recommend options;
-Sticking with the original schedule
-Rotating the schedule to fit the new timezone
-Returning to monophasic sleep

The optimal route is to stick with the original schedule during the travel, but depending on the duration of the stay rotating the schedule should also be possible. Note that rotating the schedule will cause adaptation to be set back. During adaptation it’s important to stick to all sleeping times, which is why many delay their adaptation until after they’ve travelled. 

Jetlag happens when you travel through different time zones. If you go with changing your schedule during the stay you will initially struggle to fall asleep fast in the new time zone, and your schedule will become a mess. Depending on how long your trip is, how long you stay in the new region, and how long you have been polyphasic the travel can be hard or relatively easy to handle.  

Plan the trip so your core aligns with the flight if possible. 

Try not to core in the airports, as you will be vulnerable to thefts, personal safety, etc.

If you're adapted you can flex the naps if possible. Skipping will also be more manageable, and small oversleeps tolerable.

If you haven't started your schedule yet waiting until after the travel is possibly the best option.
